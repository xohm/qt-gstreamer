/*! \example examples/player/main.cpp
 * This is an example audio/video player using QtGStreamer.
 *
 * In this example, the GStreamer playbin element is used to perform most
 * of the tasks. Our code is mostly integrating the UI with the pipeline,
 * handling state changes, doing queries to learn about the position
 * and duration of the stream, performing seeking, etc...

/*! \example examples/appsink-src/main.cpp
 * This example demonstrates how to use QGst::Utils::ApplicationSource and
 * QGst::Utils::ApplicationSink to create a custom source and sink respectively.
 *
 * In this example, we have two pipelines, one pipeline that gets data from a file,
 * decodes the audio stream and sends the audio buffers to appsink, and a second
 * pipeline that gets data from appsrc and pushes them to an audio sink. Appsink
 * from the first pipeline is linked with appsrc from the second pipeline in our
 * code, by listening to appsink's newBuffer() signal, getting the buffer
 * and pushing it to appsrc with the pushBuffer() method. The result is a choppy
 * audio player.

/*! \example examples/recorder/main.cpp
 * This is a recording application that takes audio from a microphone
 * and video from either a camera or the X11 screen, encodes them with
 * theora and speex and saves the result in a file.
 *
 * The intention of this example is to show how simple it is to perform such
 * complex tasks with GStreamer and how easy it is to change the functionality
 * of the program by changing just one element (with autovideosrc it will
 * do a webcam recording, but with ximagesrc it will do a screencast).
 *
 * Tasks demonstrated in this example include:
 * \li How to create and link elements manually.
 * \li How to create and link elements using a pipeline description.
 * \li How to use the QGst::PropertyProbe interface.
 * \li How to handle bus messages.
 * \li Others...

/*! \example examples/voip/main.cpp
 * This is a simple VoIP application that takes audio from a microphone and
 * video from the video test source, encodes them with speex and h264 respectively
 * and sends them to the other side using RTP.
 *
 * The same application is both a client and a server. To make a call between them,
 * you need to configure the destination ports of the one side to be the source
 * ports of the other and vice versa.

/*! \example examples/qmlplayer/main.cpp
 * This example demonstrates how to paint video on QML.
 *
 * Much of the code here is borrowed from the player example and it is not generally
 * a good example on how to write QML and connect it with C++. The intention is just
 * to demonstrate the use of QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoSurface, which is bound on the
 * QML context and then used by the VideoItem.
