/*! \headerfile applicationsink.h <QGst/Utils/ApplicationSink>
 * \brief Helper class for using a GstAppSink
 *
 * Appsink is a sink plugin that supports many different methods for making the application
 * get a handle on the GStreamer data in a pipeline. Unlike most GStreamer elements, appsink
 * provides external API functions. This class exports those API functions in the bindings
 * and makes it easy to implement a custom sink.
 *
 * The normal way of retrieving buffers from appsink is by using the pullBuffer() and pullPreroll()
 * methods. These methods block until a buffer becomes available in the sink or when the sink is
 * shut down or reaches EOS.
 *
 * Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming thread. If the
 * application is not pulling buffers fast enough, this queue will consume a lot of memory over
 * time. setMaxBuffers() can be used to limit the queue size. enableDrop() controls whether the
 * streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum queue size is reached.
 * Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively affect real-time performance and
 * should be avoided.
 *
 * If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, you can subclass this class and implement the
 * newPreroll(), and newSample() which will be called to notify you when a new
 * sample is available.
 *
 * setCaps() can be used to control the formats that appsink can receive. This property can contain
 * non-fixed caps. The format of the pulled buffers can be obtained by getting the buffer caps.
 *
 * If one of the pullPreroll() or pullBuffer() methods return NULL, the appsink is stopped or in
 * the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state with isEos(). The eos() virtual method can also
 * be reimplemented to be informed when the EOS state is reached to avoid polling.
 *
 * The actuall appsink element can be retrieved with element() and set with setElement(). It is
 * not necessary to set an appsink, as this class will create one as soon as it is needed.
 *
 * \note It is not necessary to use this class in order to use GstAppSink. GstAppSink
 * also provides signals and properties that fully substitute the functionality of this class.
